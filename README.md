These Python scripts plot output data from dh4gan/spin-orbit-coupled-planet , producing 2D maps and 1D curves of the flux hitting the surface of a planet with arbitrary orbital and spin parameters

The scripts depend on numpy and matplotlib only, and require a .info file (produced by spin-orbit-coupled-planet) to function correctly
